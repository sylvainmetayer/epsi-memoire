The goal of this document is to demonstrate the benefits and tools to implement a \devops{} and automation approach inside a development project. Despite the fact that this document has a technical part, it is meant to suit anybody who might want to read it.

We will begin with a history of automation, to set the background of this document. It will then detail each part inside the life cycle of an application. This will allow the reader to have an overview of the life cycle of an application.

We will then discuss a practical case, demonstrating the impacts of implementing a \devops{} and automation approach with one company, \etsy. This will show the tools and changes made by the company to perform its transition to a \devops{} approach and implement automation processes. We will also discuss the complexity to implement such a system and why deployments or developments became even more complex over time.

Finally, we will get into the concrete part of the subject with ways to implement an automation approach, from different perspectives : organizational, financial and technical along with the prerequisites of such an approach.
